Planned API Improvements
========================
file_selection should have an 'existing' option.

New Backends
============
Ask::Win32 - a native Win32 thing. Perhaps write a zenity-like command-line tool and wrap that?
Ask::Prima - pointed out by Joel Berger; dependency-light X11-based GUI toolkit
Ask::Clui - using Term::Clui??

Backend Improvements
====================
Ask::STDIO - better file selection method
Ask::Wx - support multi file selection
